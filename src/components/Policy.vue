      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>Your Privacy Rights – Effective Jan 3, 2023</p>
      <h2>Information we collect and the purposes for which we use it</h2>
      <p>Automatically collected information</p>
      <p>
        Our servers automatically collect the following information regarding devices
        that access our site or app: device characteristics (including device ID for
        mobile devices), operating system, browser type, IP address, username from
        stored cookies if present, dates and times of each login, page and image viewing
        statistics, and incoming and outgoing links. We also log the metadata associated
        with any uploaded images. We use this automatically collected anonymous data to
        analyze how our site and app are used so as to keep them optimized, to determine
        the popularity and usefulness of various features, to maintain the integrity of
        user accounts so that each user can see his or her posts and the upvotes,
        downvotes, and comments to them, and to enable users with usernames to access
        their posts, albums, and membership information.
      </p>

      <p>
        None of this information is “personal information” – that is, data we could use
        to identify a specific person. We also provide automatically collected anonymous
        data to third party advertisers and analytics companies to supplement the
        tracking information described below, but we contractually prohibit such third
        parties from combining such anonymous data with other data they may have in a
        way that could enable the identification of individuals. We also use such data
        to enable us to comply with copyright law, with 18 USC §2258A (illegal content),
        and to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including national
        security, courts, and law enforcement.
      </p>

      <p>Interactively collected information</p>
      <p>
        In addition to the automatically collected anonymous data described above, we
        may place information on your device and then retrieve it later: we may use
        cookies, web beacons, or other anonymous tracking information to improve our
        server's interaction with your device. We also partner with third party
        advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place and/or
        recognize cookies on your device that collect data about which pages and ads are
        viewed while our app or site is being used. Advertiser cookies enable customized
        ads that are selected for display on your device based on the anonymous
        information collected. No personal data is on, connected to, or derivable from,
        these cookies. If you block or disable cookies and other tracking technologies,
        instead of getting customized ads you will see non-customized (generic) ads.
        Although our servers currently don't respond to "do-not-track" requests, you can
        block tracking in other ways. If you would like more information about this
        practice and to know your choices about not having this
      </p>

      <h2>Information you choose to give us</h2>
      <p>
        When you sign in with a username, we handle it in the same way as an
        automatically collected username except that if you don’t allow cookies, you
        have to enter your username each time you log in. A username is, by nature,
        publicly posted information. On occasion we may run a contest or other type of
        promotion, and to enable us to award prizes to the winners as well as to comply
        with the applicable laws, we collect real names and contact information – so if
        you win a contest, we’ll ask for that information and we’ll use it only for
        those two specific purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect whatever personal data about you that you choose to give us, such as
        a contact email address (which we do not make public) and profile information.
        We do not require you to use an account to upload images. If you open an account
        you do not have to provide any personal information except your cell phone
        number, which we don't retain; we use it once to send you a code. (See below.)
        If you are located in the EEA and wish to open an account, do not use your real
        name – choose a username and email address that reveal nothing about your
        identity. If you give us an email address, we’ll probably send you promotional
        messages once in a while; we’ll try to make them fun and interesting but of
        course you’ll be able to opt out at any time. We may work with outside companies
        to deliver targeted advertising to you while ensuring that no personal
        information about you is ever used; for example, we may generate a one-way hash
        from the email address you provide and provide only the hash to the outside
        companies, who track only the hash. A hash can never be reversed to reveal your
        email address or any other personal information; the process is explained below.
      </p>

      <h2>Information you post</h2>
      <p>
        IMG.URL does not “collect” the stuff you post: images, comments, messages, etc.,
        and – with respect to persons in the EEA – does not “process” or determine any
        purposes for processing of any information that you manifestly make public. In
        particular, every image uploaded to IMG.URL is public – whether uploaded
        directly without going through a user account, or uploaded via a user account –
        and has its own URL. No matter what your privacy settings are, every image can
        always be accessed and viewed by anyone who types in that exact URL. No image
        uploaded to IMG.URL is ever completely hidden from public view. This is mainly
        to ensure that IMG.URL, which allows anonymous postings, will not be used as a
        platform for illegality. So too for messaging: IMG.URL allows users to send
        messages to one another both indirectly (via comments to posts) and directly
        (via chat). IMG.URL's messaging functionality is not intended to be a secure
        messaging platform; it's just for fun. To ensure that IMG.URL's messaging
        platform is not used as a platform for illegality, all messages are public. No
        messages are ever completely hidden from public view. We may monitor user
        messaging.
      </p>
      <h2>Accessing, correcting, and limiting use of your data</h2>
      <p>
        Because we don’t collect information about the identity of our users and don’t
        receive any information from third parties enabling us to identify our users, we
        have no means of knowing, or providing you with information about, whatever
        anonymous data about you we might have on our servers – unless you have a
        username. If you have a username, you may log in and access your data, correct
        whatever information you deem to be incorrect, opt out of information sharing
        with our advertisers, or delete your account. For legal reasons we may retain
        backup and/or archival copies of information prior to your corrections,
        amendments, or deletions.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        We take every reasonable precaution to protect the data on our servers from
        loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction,
        taking into account the risk level and the nature of the data. You are
        responsible for taking every reasonable precaution on your end to protect any
        unauthorized person from accessing your IMG.URL account.
      </p>
      <h2>GDPR</h2>
      <p>
        IMG.URL does not collect “personal data” about, or monitor behavior of, “data
        subjects” as those terms are defined in GDPR Art.4(1), nor do we “target”
        individuals in the EEU. Regarding the latter, see Guidelines 3/2018 on the
        territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3), Ver. 2.1 (07 Jan 2020). To contact us
        regarding privacy issues, you can email us at
        <a href="mailto:122974945@qq.com">122974945@qq.com</a>
      </p>
      <h2>Dispute resolution</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by California law, excluding its conflicts of law
        principles, and if there is a lawsuit between a user and IMG.URL, jurisdiction
        and venue will lie exclusively in the State where the defendant is located, if
        within the United States, or in Santa Clara County, California otherwise.
      </p>
      <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may revise our privacy policy from time to time by posting the changes here.
        You can determine the date of the most recent changes by looking at the
        “effective date” at the top.
